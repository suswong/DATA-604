    "### Selecting and running cells\n",
    "\n",
    "To select a cell, click in the left margin next to the cell.  You should see a blue frame surrounding the selected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a code cell, click inside the cell.  You should see a green frame around the selected cell, and you should see a cursor inside the cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "Try the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  From the Insert menu select \"Insert cell below\" to add a cell below this one.  By default, you get a code cell, as you can see in the pulldown menu that says \"Code\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  In the new cell, add a print statement like `print('Hello')`, and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Add another cell, select the new cell, and then click on the pulldown menu that says \"Code\" and select \"Markdown\".  This makes the new cell a text cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "5.  Use the arrow buttons in the toolbar to move cells up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Use the cut, copy, and paste buttons to delete, add, and move cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  As you make changes, Jupyter saves your notebook automatically, but if you want to make sure, you can press the save button, which looks like a floppy disk from the 1990s.\n",

The notebooks contain some explanatory text, but it is probably not enough to make sense if you have not read the book.  If you are working through a notebook and you get stuck, you might want to re-read (or read!) the corresponding section of the book."
